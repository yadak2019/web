                I Yadak Linus had a very hard time deciding, what I would become in future but I know I was passionate for any thin Computer I would Talk about Being a pilot, computer engineer, etc. but i wanted to start program I started with python from an online class
                called Zuri Board Where I Started to Learn it, Then I skipped it and went to php I donâ€™t Know how I came to website development but I loved it when I started a class (not online) on php but what he mostly thought us was html but we named
                our pages with a .php he also thought us inline CSS later I learnt that CSS was more than inline we have three types so I picked the external CSS and I started working with it and I could Say that external is more better than in line so
                you may be asking of my age I am only 14 years old practically 15.
