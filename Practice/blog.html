                <span style="color: black;" class="wods">Software Development is a skilled professional field in computer science that deals with construct design
                    and manage the structural development of application to the tasks associated in developing a standard
                    applications or websites hosted via intranet or Internet. In other case Software development process
                    includes the use of professional tools and programming languages both high level and low level language
                    in as much as developing a web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting and
                    network security configuration, among other tasks.
                    Learning the process of software development one can simply developed a website (a website can be
                    seen as a group of related web pages or a computer program that runs on a web server that provides
                    access to a group of related web pages. Web pages are site files, web content or related element that can
                    run on both Local Server and Remote Server).
                    However, software development is the coding or programming that enables functionality, per the
                    owner's requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design aspect of building application or websites,
                    which includes coding and writing markup. In case of web development ranges from creating plain text
                    pages to complex web-based applications, social network applications and electronic business
                    applications etc.
                    Note: when an application is developed or a website is created or built and you would like to upload it
                    to the internet you will require a Domain Name (e.g. pcsoftwareconsultant), a Host Name (e. g: .Com,
                    .Ng, .Mil, .Co etc.) and a Plan on Choice of Server you will like to upload your Files into</span>
